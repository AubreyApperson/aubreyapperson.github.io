Hi!  My name is Aubrey.  I am a technology enthusiast currently researching transistors and checking out new combinations of materials to make them with friends/coworkers/other researchers at NC State University. I've been working on a cool project to obtain Density of States (DOS) information from a technique called KPFM (Kevin Probe Force Microscopy).  That's pretty cool by itself, but I've had the pleasure of automating the entire process! This summer I have been programming in IGOR Pro to communicate with an external instrument that allows us to apply a high voltage to the sample we are studying.  I designed it so that a user tells the Atomic Force Microscope what range of voltages to scan, then the program takes over, biases the sample, scans, then continues.  Sounds easy enough I suppose.  It was a bit challenging as
